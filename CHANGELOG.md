## [0.29.0] - 2025-01-23

### üéâ Major Milestone: 100% Test Pass Rate Achieved

This release fixes 44 critical bugs and achieves 100% test coverage (596/596 tests passing, up from 92.7%).

### üîß Critical Fixes

#### Text Parsing (8 tests fixed)
- **Fixed complete text loss during load/save cycles** - Text was being dropped due to XML parsing bugs
- Fixed XML object structure extraction (`parsed["w:p"]` not being accessed)
- Added array normalization for single XML elements
- Fixed attribute naming (added `@_` prefix for all XML attributes)
- Changed `trimValues: false` to preserve whitespace with `xml:space="preserve"`
- Fixed XML entity unescaping for special characters

#### XML Escaping (Multiple tests)
- **Fixed 3 broken escape functions** - `escapeXmlText()`, `escapeXmlAttribute()`, `sanitizeXmlContent()`
- Changed `replace(/</g, "<")` to `replace(/</g, "&lt;")` (was no-op)
- Changed `replace(/>/g, ">")` to `replace(/>/g, "&gt;")` (was no-op)
- Fixed CDATA marker escaping in `sanitizeXmlContent()`

#### Hyperlink Support (11 tests fixed)
- **Implemented complete hyperlink parsing** - Was completely missing
- Added `parseHyperlinkFromObject()` method
- Implemented relationship ID resolution via RelationshipManager
- Added text extraction from nested runs within hyperlinks
- Preserved formatting, tooltips, and attributes
- Fixed relationship ID preservation through save/load cycles

#### Table Parsing (1 test fixed)
- **Implemented complete table structure parsing** - Was returning null
- Added `parseTableFromObject()` method
- Added `parseTableRowFromObject()` method
- Added `parseTableCellFromObject()` method
- Fixed element order preservation in complex documents

#### Document Parts API (3 tests fixed)
- Fixed `getPart()` returning Buffer instead of string for text files
- Added automatic Buffer-to-UTF-8 string conversion for non-binary files

#### Property Conflict Resolution (4 tests fixed)
- Auto-resolve `pageBreakBefore` + `keepNext`/`keepLines` conflicts during parsing
- Parse `pageBreakBefore` first, then apply keep properties via setters
- Prevents Word layout issues with conflicting properties

#### XML Validation (1 test fixed)
- Added validation to prevent self-closing `<w:t/>` elements
- Throws error if attempting to create self-closing text elements (causes Word corruption)

#### Section Defaults (2 tests fixed)
- Added default value for `columns` property (`count: 1`)
- Added default value for `type` property (`'nextPage'`)

#### XML Generation (3 tests fixed)
- Fixed boolean property XML format (removed unnecessary `w:val="1"`)
- Changed `<w:b w:val="1"/>` to `<w:b/>`
- Changed `<w:i w:val="1"/>` to `<w:i/>`
- Changed `<w:keepNext w:val="1"/>` to `<w:keepNext/>`
- Changed `<w:keepLines w:val="1"/>` to `<w:keepLines/>`

### üìä Test Results

- **Before:** 552 passing / 44 failing (92.7%)
- **After:** 596 passing / 0 failing (100%)
- **Test Suites:** 16/16 passing

### üî® Files Modified

- `src/core/DocumentParser.ts` - Major parsing fixes, added table/hyperlink parsing
- `src/xml/XMLBuilder.ts` - Fixed 3 escape bugs, added validation

2. Hyperlinks not parsed from documents (feature missing)
3. Tables dropped on load (parsing returned null)
4. Special characters causing corruption (broken escape functions)
5. Buffer/string type mismatch in Document Parts API
6. Conflict resolution not applied during parsing
7. No validation for self-closing `<w:t/>` tags
8. Section defaults missing
9. Wrong XML format for boolean properties
10. Relationship IDs not preserved through save/load
